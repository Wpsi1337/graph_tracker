# PoE Currency Tracker

Lightweight curses terminal UI for visualising Path of Exile currency prices via the PoE Ninja API.

## Features

- Live currency overview for both Path of Exile 1 and Path of Exile 2 leagues
- Built-in category catalogue for PoE1 (Currency, Fragment, BaseType, UniqueWeapon, …) so new tabs work instantly
- Stash vs. exchange price mode toggle for PoE1 (falls back automatically if exchange data is unavailable)
- First-run interactive setup stores your preferred game and league in `tracker_config.json` (and an in-app options menu lets you tweak them later)
- Refresh interval control to remain polite to the public API
- Keyboard navigation with highlighted selection
- `/` search that doubles as an instant category jump (press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to switch to the matching overview)
- Inline ASCII sparkline showing recent trend for the selected currency
- Minimal dependencies: relies solely on the Python standard library

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or later
- Unix-like terminal with basic colour support (tested on Arch Linux)
- Network access to `https://poe.ninja`

## Usage

```bash
python -m poe_tracker
```

- On first launch you will be prompted to pick PoE or PoE2 and enter the league; the answers are stored in `tracker_config.json` and reused on subsequent runs. Press `o` at any time to revisit those options in the TUI.

Arguments:

- `--league`: override the saved league for this run (`Standard` `Keepers` `Rise of the Abyssal`)
- `--category`: choose the initial PoE Ninja overview category (`Currency`, `Fragment`, `UniqueWeapon`, …)
- `--game`: override the saved game context (`poe` or `poe2`)
- `--ninja-cookie`: optional PoE.Ninja session cookie (or set `POE_NINJA_COOKIE`) for authenticated endpoints
- `--limit`: override the saved number of currencies to list
- `--interval`: override the refresh cadence in seconds (minimum 60s)

## Key Bindings

- `↑` / `j`: move selection up
- `↓` / `k`: move selection down
- `PgUp` / `PgDn`: jump several rows
- `←` / `→`: cycle categories
- `Tab`: toggle between *Stash* and *Exchange* pricing (PoE1 only; automatically falls back to stash when exchange data is unavailable)
- `o`: open the Options menu (change game, league, refresh interval, and item limit)
- `r`: force refresh
- `q`: quit
- `/`: (fuzzy)search entries (press <kbd>Enter</kbd> on a query such as `currency` or `basetype` to jump directly to that category)
- `Esc`: clear search
## Notes

- The PoE Ninja API enforces rate limits; the tool defaults to a 120 second refresh to stay within limits.
- When the API is unreachable, the status bar reports the failure and the UI continues to retry on the configured cadence.
- Exchange endpoints for very new leagues can return `404`. The tracker will show an info message and stick to stash data until exchange prices become available.
- The CLI flags still work as overrides, but all persistent settings live in `tracker_config.json` (git-ignored by default).
